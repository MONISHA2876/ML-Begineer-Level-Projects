# ML Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of **beginner-level Machine Learning projects** created while learning core ML concepts and algorithms.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice ML fundamentals  
- Understand how different algorithms work  
- Build consistency with small, focused projects  

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project is stored in a separate folder and usually contains:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Dataset (if required)
- A short README explaining the idea

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Covered
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- KNN  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machine  

(more will be added as I learn)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 🚀 Note
These are **learning projects**, not production-level applications.  
More advanced and deployed ML projects will be maintained in separate repositories.
